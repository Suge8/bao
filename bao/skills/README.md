# bao Skills

This directory contains built-in skills that ship with bao. User skills live in `~/.bao/workspace/skills/` (auto-discovered, highest priority).

## Skill Format

Each skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file with:
- YAML frontmatter (name, description, metadata)
- Markdown instructions for the agent

## Attribution

The skill format and metadata structure follow [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) conventions to maintain compatibility with the ClawHub skill ecosystem.
